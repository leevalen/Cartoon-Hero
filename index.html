	<h2>About Ōno Akira</h2>
	<p><b>Ōno Akira,</b>also spelled <b>OŌno Akira</b>, is the main character of <i>Hi Score Girl</i> series.</p>
	<h3>Appearance</h3>
	<p>Akira is a beautiful girl with dark purple hair and ruby eyes. As an ojō-sama, she is always well dressed with expensive-looking clothes. Many find her apperance alongside her attitude intimidating but most just find her attractive.However, the main outfit through out the series consists with long violet dress that has a black belt with a black shirt which has grey sleeves with a yellow button on each and her belt. She also wears dark purple leggings/stocking under her dress with matching shoes.</p>
	<h3>Personality</h3>
	<p>Akira is good at everything she does, including study, drawing, music, martial arts, and video games. <br> Despite being very smart, she never talked. Most likely it's part of the plot that she doesn't talk at all in the story. Most of the time, Haruo can read her facial expressions to guess what she's thinking and wanting. She makes small voices like "Umm", nodding, and shaking her head as a way to say yes or no. Sometimes she points her finger at things she wants. <br> Surprisingly, it's not that hard for Haruo (and the readers/viewers) to understand her. <br> As a rich girl, she has good manners in general, except for her habit to make a "mogaaa" (モガー) sound when putting food in her mouth. <br> She hates scary things such as horror films and games.<br> She uses violence sometimes, mostly on Haruo, when she feels angry, jealous, or being scared of horror stuffs.</p>
	<h3>Gaming</h3>
	<p>Akira is good at almost every game on the Arcade platform. For fighting games, she uses huge power-type characters such as<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zangief">
	Zangief</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Honda">Edmond Honda</a>. She also loves characters that have similarities to <a target="_blank"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoBAhLdxzFs">Zangief's cyclone ability</a>. <br> She doesn't have any game console at home, so she's not good at using a controller at first.She doesn't like any horror games.</p>
